# It's flutter.io completitions for zsh

I love develop with flutter.io, but instead using IDE tools I prefer develop with cli tools, in this reason i created this completitions for my favorite shell, i heard about Mac guys that they like ZSH to. well, I hope you try this, bros.

This script based on output of ```$flutter help``` command for each flutter's subcommands.
